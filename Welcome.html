      <h2>The family has run the restaurant since 1950. Initially it was only a small tavern where the Venetians met to drink a "ombra de vin" and to chat with their friends quietly smoking a cigarette. At that time, in the room, you could also buy salt and cigarettes in number. Even today, however, it is frequented mainly by residents of the city.
          In 1970 he lost the rustic appearance of a tavern and acquired the characteristics of a simple Bar. They call it the "buranelli bar" because the inhabitants of Burano, when they dismount from the "boat" to the Fondamenta Nuove, before venturing to Venice, stop all in this place to do "do ciacoe" (two chatter).
          In 1992, the room underwent important renovations that greatly changed its appearance. The new structure and the original interior design offer a wonderful mix between the modern and the conservation of the 1600 structure.
          In 1997 it changed its intended use and returned to its former glory with the opening of a restaurant. Furthermore, it expands its capacity by building a suggestive terrace overlooking the north lagoon. From here, comfortably seated, you can savor wonderful dishes admiring the quiet and peaceful panorama that opens in front of you and then you can decide to take the boat that will take you to Murano, Burano, Sant'Erasmo or Torcello.</h2>
